How to rebuild the game from the sources:

Anyhow, you'll need:

- Windows XP, Vista, 7

Win32 target prerequesites:

- Code::Blocks nightly build (the latest): http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html
- MinGW TDM (gcc 4): http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/
- SDL: http://www.libsdl.org

Nintendo DS target prerequesites:

- Code::Blocks nightly build (the latest): http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html
- devkitpro 1.5 or higher: http://www.devkitpro.org/
- modified SDL (get it in this archive in the "src" dir)

Amiga classic target prerequesites:

- AmiDevCpp (contains 68k cross compiler): http://amidevcpp.amiga-world.de/index.php?HR_LANG=english
- Amiga SDL: http://aminet.net/dev/misc/SDL-Amiga.lha



To install SDL includes & libs, I took the shortest path: copy SDL header files in the "include" dir of MinGW, and
SDL lib files in the "lib" dir of MinGW.

Adapt devkitpro path to your path in .cbp file (same thing for MinGW if you did not install it in C:)

Click on the .cbp file and compile whatever target you need:

- Debug: the win32 debug version
- Release: the win32 optimized/no symbols version
- Debug256: the win32 8-bit version (to validate NDs display/effects)
- NDS: Nintendo DS M3/R4/whatever card
- NDS Emu: creates a .nds file with embedded file for use with emulators



Nintendo DS SDL issues (with devkitpro 1.5 and higher)

- sound not working/locking up the machine
- conflicts with maxmod (replaces broken sound stuff)
- timers not working
- input not working properly
- does not compile unless patched

This program uses a modified version of the SDL NDS port:

- line 200 of SDL_ndsvideo.c, I commented out the following lines
    powerOn(POWER_ALL);
	irqInit();
	irqSet(IRQ_VBLANK, on_irq_vblank); 
	irqEnable(IRQ_VBLANK);
- replaced some obsolete calls by new calls (powerON => powerOn)
- recompiled with the correct arch/cpu options (else SDL_LoadBMP crashed)

So SDL is "only" used to load BMP files, and perform image conversions and blits (which is already very handy and allows
me to make a rather portable code)
