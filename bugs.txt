tofix:

unzip et test sur machine sans PATH


minor/(maybe) to code later:

extreme mode: guards falling on player if player in the elevator (like in super bagman) + "hard" bag layout at start, and harder bag layout then
sometimes guards go in opposite direction despite the opposite direction avoidance mechanism
sometimes guards choose a direction, then change it (in an intersection) when seeing player
can sometimes release pickaxe in slope (very rare)
NDS: gameover clearscreen
game demo
hiscores
drop bag while music playing: a moi le magot + extra music. Should not play extra music
figure out some (maybe) missing random decisions in the original game (guards leaving/waiting for the elevator)
figure out when music is played: number of chances
NDS: close lid: pause
1ED6: continue RESOURCE

AmigaOS:

- bag positions y ko: fixed??? well not really
- font positions x ko: merge Fonts.cpp/Fonts.hpp avec #define
- clipping to avoid that a bob writes past end of the screen: done
- partial image blits X/Y: done
- draw filled rectangle handle color (0): done
- draw background around characters before drawing (amigaOS): done, still issues
- super slow fonts: bonus + player 1: optim if dest x % 8 == 0 with bytes copy
- mirror still not working properly ?????
- study palette to reduce to 16 colors: OK du coup 12 couleurs...
- restore background ne marche pas sur les autres écrans 1 & 2 pb repère
- blit with width=46: bug. Maybe not a serious issue since all widths>16 should be multiple of 16
- pick bag no update of bag on ground
- save zone size depending on object type (guard/player , wagon, elevator, bag)
- sprite artifacts!!!
- pick bag sometimes works very far from bag / same for pick kludge in GfxObjectLayer around 51
- carrying pickaxe on ladder: pickaxe position shifted
- lives blink/flash/missing some lives
- major rework: added logical width, for collisions. image width is used in lowlevel routines (blitter)
  => fixes a lot of wrong hitbox bugs
- reworked wall break (not too visible...)
- on killed: not enough time to play the "aiaiaiaie" sample
- added priority to sounds
- AMIGA: ESC+pause: ok mais joypad pas pris en compte. Check si pas 2 fois read joypad, use lowlevel??
- trainer/trainer keys (démarrer avec fire pressed?)
- slow refresh = bugs (elevator)

bugs:

- die: half-refresh blink (not reproduced)


enhancements:
  
- trainer: add 2 more lives / slower guard speedup?
